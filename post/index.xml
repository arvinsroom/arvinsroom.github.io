      <description>Welcome to my personal website!
This will be the prospective home of discussions surrounding my research, updates on the Mock Social Media Website Project, hot takes, bugs as a result of unnecessary tinkering to the website, and maybe even some of my artwork in the future.
I encourage you to get to know more about me, my research interests, the Mock Social Media Website Project, and take a look at my CV.</description>
